# Python-Email-Otp-Verification
A Python project for implementing email-based One-Time Password (OTP) verification.This repository is useful for developers looking to add an additional layer of security to their applications through email verification

Secure Authentication With OTP Verification via E-mail
I created an OTP Verification System in Python to help secure email logins.

It quickly generates a 6-digit OTP and sends it to the user's email.

Users just enter the code/OTP to get access.

The system verifies if the entered OTP matches the generated one and grants access accordingly.

Key features include OTP generation, email sending, OTP verification, error handling
